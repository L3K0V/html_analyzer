# HtmlAnalyzer

This gem provides a simple way to identify elements on a web page such a header, navigation and footer also modifying webpages on the fly.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'html_analyzer'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install html_analyzer

## Usage

### Analyse html
Analysing HTML provides information about the structure of the webpage.
For example you can obtain if page contains header, footer of has navigation.
You can extract links from these components if exists.

In order to check some page if contains header, you can:

```ruby
page = HtmlAnalyzer.analyze('https://github.com/')

page.header?
=> true
page.header.get_probability
=> 0.4

# You can check if header contains a navigation

page.header.navigation?
=> true

page.navigation_in_header?
=> true

# The difference between two methods are that navigation_in_header will return true
# if main navigation is in the header. Header can contains some context navigation.

# Also there is way to determine if page have a footer

page.footer?
=> true
page.footer.get_probability
=> 0.4

# Checking if there is a navigation, presume this will find the main navigation

page.navigation?
=> true
page.navigation.get_probability
=> 0.6
```

You can get the element if exist by calling

```ruby
page.header
# or the footer
page.footer
# or the navigation
page.navigation
```

> Notice that probability is the probability element to be a main navigation element.

### Modify html
Currently the gem support a way to return a modified version of the webpage HTML
*excluding* the footer, header and the navigation.

```ruby
HtmlAnalyzer.modify('https://github.com/')
```

#### Post-processing

Modify method provide way to post-process the document before return of the HTML of the page.
You can access and modify the document passing a block and do whatever you want as a post process.

```ruby
page = HtmlAnalyzer.modify('http://mobil.mopo.de/', user_agent = HtmlAnalyzer::PHONE_USER_AGENT) do |document|
  content = document.search("//div[@class='offcanvas-pagecontent']").first
  content['style'] = 'margin-left: 0%'
end
```

### User agent

```ruby
# by default HtmlAnalyzer will analyze as dekstop
page = HtmlAnalyzer.analyze('https://github.com/', HtmlAnalyzer::DESKTOP_USER_AGENT)
html = HtmlAnalyzer.modify('https://github.com/', HtmlAnalyzer::DESKTOP_USER_AGENT)

# or analyze/process as phone
page = HtmlAnalyzer.analyze('https://github.com/', HtmlAnalyzer::PHONE_USER_AGENT)
html = HtmlAnalyzer.modify('https://github.com/', HtmlAnalyzer::PHONE_USER_AGENT)
```
