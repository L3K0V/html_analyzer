### Analyse html
Analysing HTML provides information about the structure of the webpage.
For example you can obtain if page contains header, footer of has navigation.
You can extract links from these components if exists.

In order to check some page if contains header, you can:

```ruby
page = HtmlAnalyzer.analyze('https://github.com/')

page.header?
=> true
page.header.probability
=> 0.25

# You can check if header contains a navigation

page.header.navigation?
=> true


# Also there is way to determine if page have a footer

page.footer?
=> true
page.footer.probability
=> 0.4

# Checking if there is a navigation, presume this will find the main navigation

page.navigation?
=> true
page.navigation.probability
=> 0.6
```

HtmlAnalyzer.modify('https://github.com/')
